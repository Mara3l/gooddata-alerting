# How To Create Alerts in GoodData

If you wish to set alerts for specific metrics or visualizations in GoodData, this tutorial will guide you through the process of using the [GoodData Python SDK](https://www.gooddata.com/docs/python-sdk/). Alerts enhance your monitoring capabilities for critical metrics and automate the notification process, which can assist you in preventing serious issues. With the flexibility of the GoodData Python SDK, you aren't limited to just one predefined solution, so you can customize it to your heart's content.

## Prerequisites:

- [GoodData Cloud](https://www.gooddata.com/developers/cloud-native/doc/cloud/deploy-and-install/cloud/) and [GoodData API token](https://www.gooddata.com/developers/cloud-native/doc/cloud/getting-started/create-api-token/)
- S3 bucket
- SMTP server to send emails (for example, Gmail)
    - `Tip: [What Is Gmail SMTP and How to Use Gmail With My Domain?](https://www.siteground.com/kb/gmail-smtp-server/)`
- We reccomend you to use [Python virtual environment](../README.md#setup-virtual-environment)

`Note: You can still create alerts without an S3 bucket, but your capabilities will be limited. This is because the S3 bucket is used to store information about notifications that have already been sent. Without it, you will receive the same notification repeatedly.`

## Disclaimer:

- It works *only* with visualization type *Headline*

## Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
# install all dependencies defined in requirements.txt 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Step 2: Setup all environment variables

```bash
export GOODDATA_HOST='<gooddata-host>'
export GOODDATA_TOKEN='<gooddata-token>'
export GOODDATA_WORKSPACE_ID='<gooddata-workspace-id>'
export S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID='<s3-access-key-id>'
export S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='<s3-secret-access-key'
export S3_BUCKET_NAME='<s3-bucket-name>'
export EMAIL_PASSWORD='<email-password>'
```

`Tip: You can find the GoodData host and GoodData workspace ID in the URL <GOODDATA_HOST>/dashboards/#/workspace/<GOODDATA_WORKSPACE_ID>.`
    
## Step 3: Define thresholds

```yaml
visualizations:
    - id: <visualization-id> # id of visualization
      column: <entity-id> # the number to watch, it is the name of column returned from GoodData pandas dataframe
      threshold: <threshold> # threshold number, for example 300
      threshold_type: uptrends # threshold type can be 'uptrends' or 'downtrends'
    - id: <visualization-id> # id of visualization
      column: <entity-id> # the number to watch, it is the name of column returned from GoodData pandas dataframe
      threshold: <threshold> # threshold number, for example 4
      threshold_type: downtrends # threshold type can be 'uptrends' or 'downtrends'
```

`Tip: You can find the GoodData visualization ID if you open Analytics Designer with a specific visualization: <GOODDATA_HOST>/analyze/#/<GOODDATA_WORKSPACE_ID>/<GOODDATA_VISUALIZATION_ID>/edit.`
    
## Step 4: Define time to run alerting

In the [gooddata_alerting.py](../gooddata_aleting.py), you can adjust your preferred time to run alerting..

```python
schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(main)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

`Tip: If you prefer, you can also run it during cache invalidation.`

## Step 5: Run it! ðŸš€

```bash
$ python gooddata_alerting.py
```

## How does it work?

The best demonstration of the whole functionality is the following script:

```python
for new_id, new_item in new_dict.items():
    old_item = old_dict.get(new_id)
    
    if old_item:
        if new_item.notify and not old_item.notified_before:
            notification.send_email("Alert!", f"Visualization with id {new_item.id} has reached threshold!")
            new_item.notified_before = True
    
        if old_item.notified_before and new_item.notify:
            new_item.notified_before = True
    
        if old_item.notified_before and not new_item.notify:
            new_item.notified_before = False
    else:
        if new_item.notify:
            notification.send_email("Alert!", f"Visualization with id {new_item.id} has reached threshold!")
            new_item.notified_before = True
```

- `new_dict` contains all the information about the current 'numbers' from GoodData.
- `old_item` contains all the information about past 'numbers' from GoodData, for example, from yesterday.
- If there are no past 'numbers,' the script sends a notification when a visualization reaches a defined threshold.
- If there are past 'numbers,' the script checks whether a visualization has reached a defined threshold; if so, it will send a notification.
    - If a notification has already been sent, the script does nothing.
    - If a visualization has dropped below a defined threshold, the script resets the notification mechanism (to send a notification once the threshold is reached again).
    
`Note: You can also check other items in services or utils. However, these are, let's say, just regular Python components that make the entire alerting system work.`
